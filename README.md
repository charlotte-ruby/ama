# charlotte-ruby/ama

A repository to ask the members of [@charlotte-ruby](https://github.com/charlotte-ruby/ama) anything.

If you have a question about the group, suggestions for meetups, or really anything, this is just the joint for you.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/charlotte-ruby/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

We'll try to answer it as soon as we can get to it. Once answered the issue will be closed
just so we know what's been covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and someone will get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/charlotte-ruby/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions answered in the past. We try
to use this as a public forum and email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping us on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. We're [@cltrb](https://twitter.com/cltrb) on
Twitter.
